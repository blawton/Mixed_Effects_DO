# Mixed_Effects_DO

This is a small program intended to show how a mixed effects linear regression can capture the relationship between Temperature and Dissolved Oxygen at several stations across the Long Island Sound which are grouped by measurement site location to avoid spurious correlation of residuals. It works on a subset of the data from the Repository "Long Island Sound GPR", namely the STS Continuous Data.

This program was originally a jupyter notebook, but was then converted via Jupytext to a python script.
